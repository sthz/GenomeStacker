Genome stacker is an interactive comparative genome browser purposed for faster and more efficient research in an online environment. 
With the knowledge of the comparative genome viewer’s Genome Stacker was made to match all the important criteria. Genome stacker is 
a program that creates a comparative web based interactive genome browser. Developed for the purpose of comparing,
